# type-challenges

My solution to [type-challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges) to improve my TypeScript skills. **Must be used with IDE that supports TypeScript on-the-fly for the best experience**

## Solutions

Solutions are separated by difficulty sections in form of directories. Each directories contains `<challenge-name>.ts` that contains solution for `challenge-name`.

## Practice

I also practised by creating utility types for personal use-cases. All utility types can be found on the `practice` folder.

## How to run

You don't. Just ensure that the code doesn't have TypeScript IntelliSense errors.
